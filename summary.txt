Nets 150 Final Project: Analysis of Amazon Movie Reviews

For this project, we wanted to test a number of properties for Amazon movie
reviews. We used data from the Stanford site and the data set we used to test
these properties included 10,000 movie reviews. The entire data set contained
many more movies but we decided to cap it off there because the heap overflowed
each time. We decided not to include the data set in our zip file or the full
data set in our project because it was so large but here is the link to our data
set: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Movies.html.

Our project fits into the empirical analysis category.  In the summary report
file attached, we included our hypotheses, conclusions, and graphs.  Also included
in the zip file is the code we wrote and used to test our hypotheses.  Our project
used document search to test our hypotheses and social networks to check for 
triadic closures (more information is in the summary report).

To set up our code, we made a MovieReader class that reads in every review and
initializes Movie and User objects.  The code reads in each line of a review,
and assigns it to a variable.  We then create User and Movie objects depending
on if our user and movie sets already contain the current user or movie.  If they
do, then we just add the review to the user’s/movie’s review set.

We both helped with the MovieReader, Movie, and User classes.  Sam was in charge
of questions 1 and 2, and Talia was in charge of questions 3 and 4.
